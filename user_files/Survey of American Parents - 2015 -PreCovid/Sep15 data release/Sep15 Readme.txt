2015 PARENTING SURVEY
September 15-October 13, 2015
TOTAL N=1,807 adult parents (ages 18+) of children younger than 18
***************************************************************************************************************************

The survey was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International by telephone among a nationally representative sample of adult parents 
of children under 18 living in the United States.

Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.

National sample: N=1,807 adult parents of children younger than 18 (n=937 fathers; n=870 mothers)

The margin of sampling error for the complete set of weighted data is ± 2.7 percentage points 
(± 3.7 percentage points for fathers; ±3.9 percentage points for mothers)

The survey covers a range of topics on parenting in America, including parents' assessments of the job they are doing raising their children, 
parenting values and philosphies, child care arrangements and participation in activities and parental invovlement in their children's education and activities.

This dataset includes interviews conducted via cell phone (n=1,172; including 697 without a landline phone) and landline (n=635) using RDD samples.

At three points during the fielding of the survey, revisions were made to the questionnaire. In most cases, cuts were made in order to reduce length
of the questionnaire and the variables that were cut do not appear in the final dataset. In one case, a new question (Q41C) was added and is only 
available for respondents who completed the survey after the first night. In another case, questions Q.1 and Q.2 were moved prior to the screener question for 
parents of children under 18 (P.1). Please also note that the total survey length for the different iterations of the survey varies somewhat due to these edits. 
The variable "version" indicates which version was administered - later versions were shorter in length.


Variables filterc.1 and filterc.2 are created using the syntax specified under FILTER C in the questionnaire. Because the values of FILTER C in the questionnaire
are not mutually exclusive, FILTER C was divided into two variables in the dataset, filterc.1 and filterc.2. Variable filterc.1 identifies parents who have at least 
one child ages 0 to 5. A value of 1 indicates the parent has only one child ages 0 to 5 and a value of 2 indicates that the parent has more than one child ages 0 to 5. 
Variable filterc.2 identifies parents who have at least one child ages 6 to 17. A value of 3 indicates that the parent has only one child ages 6 to 17 and a value of 4
indicates that the parent has more than one child ages 6 to 17.

Note: The WEIGHT variable is weighting variable intended for use on all questions.

The Pew Research Center uses respondents’ self-reported zip code as the basis for geographic variables such as region,state and county. 
We continue to include the original sample geographic variables in the datasets (these variables are preceded by an ‘s’, based on respondents' phone number).
for archival purposes only.

To protect the privacy of respondents, telephone numbers, zip code, some open-ended responses and other identifying variables have been removed 
from the public data file.

Some special technical variables were also removed, but are available upon request.
